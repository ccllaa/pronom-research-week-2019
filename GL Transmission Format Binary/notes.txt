Description:
glTFâ„¢ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. It is an API-neutral runtime asset delivery format. glTF bridges the gap between 3D content creation tools and modern 3D applications by providing an efficient, extensible, interoperable format for the transmission and loading of 3D content. Binary glTF is a container format in which an entire glTF asset (JSON asset description, binary geometry, key frames, skins and images) can be stored in a single binary blob.

The binary blob has the following structure:
    A 12-byte preamble, entitled the header.
    One or more chunks that contains JSON content and binary data.

The 12 byte header consists of three 4-byte entries:
    uint32 magic   (0x46546C67)
    uint32 version (0x00000002)
    uint32 length  (The total length of the Binary glTF, including Header and all Chunks, in bytes)

Each Chunk has the following structure:
    uint32 chunkLength (the length of chunkData in bytes)
    uint32 chunkType   (the type of chunk, 0x4E4F534A for JSON, 0x004E4942 for BIN)
    ubyte[] chunkData  (binary payload of a chunk)

There must be 1 JSON Chunk and 0 or 1 Binary Chunks.
