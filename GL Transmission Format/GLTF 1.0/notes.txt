Description:
glTFâ„¢ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. It is an API-neutral runtime asset delivery format. glTF bridges the gap between 3D content creation tools and modern 3D applications by providing an efficient, extensible, interoperable format for the transmission and loading of 3D content. Binary glTF is a container format in which an entire glTF asset (JSON asset description, binary geometry, key frames, skins and images) can be stored in a single binary blob.

The gltf contains a JSON format that must contain a top-level "asset" property. The "asset" property must contain a "version" property with a value equal to "1.0".
