<cmt>PONDEROSA PARK</cmt>
<desc>Ponderosa State Park covers most of a 1,000-acre peninsula that juts into Payette Lake, just outside McCall. The character of the park is molded by its diverse topography. It ranges from arid sagebrush flats to a lakeside trail; from flat, even ground to steep cliffs; and from dense forest to spongy marsh. Nature trails and dirt roads have been developed so visitors can enjoy these areas. Camping is available in the park and in nearby Lakeview Village.</desc>

<desc>Josephine Lake is an easy trail located about 15 miles North of McCall,Idaho. Access to the trailhead is by four-wheel drive vehicle or mountain bike because the logging road which leads to the trailhead is in extremely poor condition and is not suitable for motor vehicles. Make this a longer hike by parking on Warren Wagon Road and hiking the entire distance.</desc>
