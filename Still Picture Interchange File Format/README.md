# Still Picture Interchange File Format (SPIFF) 2.0, fmt/113

See also [SPIFF 1.0, fmt/112](http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt%2F112),
which already has a signature.

The [format specification for SPIFF](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.84)
consists of two documents, ITU-T Recommendation T.84 and ITU-T Recommendation
T.84 - Amendment 1. The recommendation itself defines version 1.0 on page 42.
This is reflected by the entry for fmt/112. The amendment allows the
introduction of new parameters in the header of a SPIFF file which would lead to
a version increase. This requires a registration procedure as described by
[ITU-T Recommendation T.86](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.86), which also has
an amendment containing a list of known APPn application markers, but does not
mention any SPIFF version increase.

*To summarize, I have come to doubt that version 2.0 of the SPIFF format
actually exists. Maybe you could check my supposition and either provide me with
further documentation or consider deprecating the fmt/113 entry?*
